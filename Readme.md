# Django Portfolio/Blog website

A basic thing I created while learning working with Django and databases and the templating language. Uses bootstrap css.

To run this project on your own computer, clone this repo and install the packages listed in requirements.txt (preferrably in a virtualenv). Please do not misuse my personal pictures :).
